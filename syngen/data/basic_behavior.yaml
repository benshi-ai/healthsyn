# Definition of behaviors and applicable nudges (see behavior.MarkovBehavior)

# Behavioral archetypes correspond to chains that represent the basic behavior
#  patterns.
# Nudges are essentially control signals that affect the latent stochastic
#  dynamics of the chain by blending archetypal behaviors. Each nudge has a
#  set of tags, each describing a __effect__ on the behavior blend. A nudge
#  may have several tags, which means that the corresponding effects are added
#  together.
# Each effect is a so called __propensity direction__ vector, that determines
#  which behavioral archetypes are most affected and by how much. When applied
#  this vector shifts the current blend in the direction of the corresponding
#  direction, __respecting__ the geometry of the probability simplex:
#    new_blend = softmax(direction + log(old_blend)) .
# Since the blending weights __must sum to one__, this means that any change
#  affects the weights of all behavioral archetypes, even those that were not
#  specified.

# Archetypes are a mapping from names into YAML chain definitions. Each definition
#  is specified either through an absolute path to YAML, or as a filename without
#  extension, that is looked up inside the syngen repo's data sub-module.
archetypes:
  inactive: chain_inactive
  active: chain_active
  churned: chain_churned

# The propensity direction vector for each tag is specified via a mapping from
#  archetype name into an arbitrary numeric value (omitted values implicitly
#  default to __zero__)! Direction vectors without implicit zeros are __SHIFT
#  INVARIANT__, which means that their effect on each behavior component in the
#  blend is determined ONLY by the deviation from the average value across the
#  entire vector. The larger the deviation the stronger the effect on the blend's
#  component. The sign of the deviation determines whether the effect reinforces
#  a behavior (+ve), or inhibit it (-ve).
